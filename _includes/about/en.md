**Hi, I'm Xin Jinghao (or Cangxi on Social Media), a PhD student currently being tortured by the graduation season...**

> I'm currently job hunting. If you have any good job recommendations, please contact me!! [xjhzsj2019@sjtu.edu.cn](mailto:xjhzsj2019@sjtu.edu.cn)

-----------



I'm currently studying in the Department of Automation at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, with research areas in end-to-end local path planning (deep reinforcement learning) and real-time global path planning (optimization algorithms).



I love motocycle and adventure. I've solo motorcycle toured 8000 Km+. The most unforgettable cycling trip was from Chongqing back to Shanghai starting on 2022/08/20, right after the pandemic ended. It was my first motorcycle tour, and I felt like a little bird~
